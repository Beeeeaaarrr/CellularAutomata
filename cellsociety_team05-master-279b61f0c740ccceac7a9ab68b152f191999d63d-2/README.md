#### Names of all people who worked on the project
>Christian Martindale, Mina Mungekar, and Justin Wang

#### Date you started, date you finished, and an estimate of the number of hours worked on the project
>We started working on the project on January 26th, when we first engaged in the planning process as a team. The project was finished on February 13th, with each person contributing an estimated 35 hours to the project. 

#### Each person's role in developing the project
>Each team member assumed a distinct role for the project, with Justin developing the XML files, parser, and states, Christian designing the cell and society classes, and Mina working on the user interface, animation, and associated population chart. Towards the end of the project, each team member worked on classes outside the scope of their initial roles in order to better integrate the project into a whole.

#### Any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
>StackExchange was used as a resource to find solutions to specific problems. Java documentation was used throughout the project for us to gain a general sense of the tools available to help us meet the project requirements.

#### Files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)
>Main.java

#### Files used to test the project
>XML files

#### Any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)
>There is an associated XML file that reads in initial game parameters for each society; additionally, there is a properties file used to hold strings and values called upon in the UI, Animation, and Chart classes. The XML parser and society classes all have associated enums.

#### Any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
>The project consists of a user interface that presents a drop-down menu which allows the user to initialize a game simulation. The user can control simulation parameters such as animation rate through the UI; furthermore, he or she can choose from four different simulation types to run. Each simulation is capable of being run on square, triangular, or hexagonal cells. The user can , in addition, click on individual cells to dynamically change their states within the simulation.

#### Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
>Minor issues with UI include lagging.

#### Any extra features included in the project
>The project can be run with a variety of cell shapes; furthermore, certain simulation parameters can change to accommodate user preference. Properties and simulation parameters are controlled through external files; exception handling is included in several of the main classes. The user interface, in addition, displays a grid mapping out population parameters of each cell type. Users can also click on cells to dynamically change their states.

#### Your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
>The assignment was both challenging and rewarding in that it was difficult to create a single simulation that accommodated for four different sets of rules; however, there were many enjoyable aspects of implementing a running cell simulation. We were introduced to many new, useful concepts through the course of this project.
